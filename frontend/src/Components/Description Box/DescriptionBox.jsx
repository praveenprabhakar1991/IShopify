            <p className='p-2'>Ecommerce refers to when individuals or companies buy and sell goods or services online. Ecommerce can take place within a company's smartphone app, on a social media platform, or in an online marketplace. You can participate in ecommerce anywhere you can establish an internet connection. Common examples includes online shopping, electronic payments, online auctions, and internet banking.

            <p className='p-2'>An ecommerce platform is a service that allows you to make money online through your own website. I-Shopify is an example of an ecommerce company that enables individuals, creators, and businesses of all sizes to sell online and in person through a brick-and-mortar store. You can easily sell to existing audiences on channels you already manage without building an ecommerce website.
